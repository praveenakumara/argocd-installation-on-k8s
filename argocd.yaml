# ArgoCD Installation Part 2 - Quick Start
Argo CD is a declarative continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes applications. It uses the GitOps style to create and manage Kubernetes clusters. When any changes are made to the application configuration in Git, Argo CD will compare it with the configurations of the running application and notify users to bring the desired and live state into sync.

Argo CD has been developed under the Cloud Native Computing Foundationâ€™s (CNCF) Argo Project- a project, especially for Kubernetes application lifecycle management. The project also includes Argo Workflow, Argo Rollouts, and Argo Events.. Each solves a particular set of problems in the agile development process and make the Kubernetes application delivery scalable and secure.
